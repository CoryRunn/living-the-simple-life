This is a 3-page website project from Kevin Powell's Responsive Web Design Course on Scrimba.com. 
I watched Kevin build it and then I coded it on my own, the results of which you see here.

It was excellent practice in coding a layout with Flexbox. 
Learned some really cool things like re-ordering flex items, and using the same images but changing their sizes (object-fit).
